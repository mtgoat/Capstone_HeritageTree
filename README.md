# Heritage Tree
---
## Overview
This app is to keep track of heritage trees in a neighborhood or town.  The app services to three roles. First, the app lets the general public submit a heritage tree candidate to a tree board who will decide whether the reported tree will be considered to be a heritage tree.  Second, the app lets the tree board review and decide whether the reported tree is a heritage tree.  Then the app will display the heritage trees in a map.  Third, the app lets the city arborists add maintenance logs to a heritage tree.
